# Introduction

The Requirements Engineering (RE) Quick Check is designed to provide RE practitioners with a simple tool to assess the status quo of their requirements handling practices in their software development projects with other organisations. This survey consists of questions about demographic information, methods and techniques used, and processes in the participant's workspace. After answering the survey, you have the possibilty to specify what kind of companies your answers should be compared to.

We envision that the Quick Check will enable RE practitioners to determine the status quo of their RE process and derive optimisation potentials from it.

    <b>Example:</b> You only want to be compared with participants from the same sector and a RE team size smaller than 10. This is done by selecting the sector in the corresponding questions and the answers 1 to 5 and 6 to 10 for the question on team size.

<!-- From this point, you can now gain insights into the established methods for the different phases of RE and learn what problems, causes and effects are common in the different types of projects. These findings can give you the opportunity to find out for yourself whether there is a need for optimisation and in which areas there is potential for optimisation in your company. !-->
